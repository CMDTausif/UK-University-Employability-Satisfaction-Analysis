# UK-University-Employability-Satisfaction-Analysis

This project presents a detailed analysis of employability rates, average salaries, international student ratios, satisfaction levels, and other key metrics across top UK universities and courses. The objective was to uncover meaningful patterns and generate actionable insights that can help students, academic institutions, and policymakers make informed decisions.

The analysis covers:
- Top-paying courses and institutions
- Courses with consistently high satisfaction
- Gender balance and international diversity
- Courses with declining employment rates
- Institutions with strong performance in employability

The final report includes data-driven insights, recommendations, and a storytelling section to visualise findings effectively.
